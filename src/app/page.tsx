            Here, you&#39;ll find a glimpse into my experience as a developer and a
            showcase of my projects. Each project comes with a brief description
            and a link to its repository for you to delve into the code.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-5">
            Throughout my journey, I&#39;ve delved into various types of
            technologies and roles from building mobile application to working
            with robotics. However, my expertise lies in Fullstack development,
            working with React, Node, and TypeScript. I&#39;m also skilled in
            leveraging AWS and Firebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I have fun by reading fantasy novels, biking round
            town and playing board games in my free time. I&#39;m passionate about
            creating meaningful and user-friendly solutions, so take a look
            around and don&#39;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or
            ideas. Thanks for stopping by!
