### This web portfolio uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is then deployed using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

### To run it locally, we can do so by:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

In this portfolio you'll find a showcase of my projects and a glimpse into my skills as a developer. Each work experience and project comes with a brief description and a link to its repository for you to delve into the code. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
